# userscripts
A few Tampermonkey userscripts I made for myself to make my life a bit easier.

## floating-image.user.js

When you hover over a link you'll get a floating window with the image inside to preview it.

## messenger-dkey.user.js

As a student who often relies on others' notes and has to unfortunately get them from Messenger I need this to quickly download images from the Messenger image slideshow. It just basically finds a button with a text "Download" and click it.
