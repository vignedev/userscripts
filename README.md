# userscripts
A few Tampermonkey userscripts I made for myself to make my life a bit easier.

## floating-image.user.js

When you hover over a link you'll get a floating window with the image inside to preview it.

## messenger-dkey.user.js

As a student who often relies on others' notes and has to unfortunately get them from Messenger I need this to quickly download images from the Messenger image slideshow. It just basically finds a button with a text "Download" and click it.

## twimg-orig.user.js

Whenever you open an Twitter image in a new tab it's going to automatically redirect you to the highest resolution available.

## pretty-json.user.js

Prettifies (or tries to) every page that ends with `.json`.

## ggpht-orig.user.js

Similiar to `twimg-orig.user.js`, any images (eg. community posts, emotes etc.) from YouTube opened are going to redirect you to the highest resolution available.

## yt-nosubs.user.js

Hides all instances of subscriber counts from the site.
